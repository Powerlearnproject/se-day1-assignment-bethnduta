Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
**Software engineering is the art of creating and running programs using code and maintaining the software systems to ensure they are reliable.
makes work easier
Reliability
Scalability 
Efficiency
facilitates problem solving
Enhances security**

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Requirement engineering- crucial initial phase of the software development life cycle, focusing on identifying needs, wishes and expectations of the software to be built.
object oriented programming- 1980 and 1990s saw the rise of oop, which introduced the concept of objects that encapsulate data and the methods that operate on that data
Agile manifesto- a cornerstone of software engineering history, emerged as an alternative to traditional, rigid development processes triggering broad adoption of agile methods.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning- defining project scope, objectives, feasibility and resource allocation
Requirement analysis- gathering and analyzing business and user requirements
Design- creating system architecture, database structures and UI/UX designs.
Implementation(coding)- writing and developing the software based on design specifications
Testing- checking for bugs, errors, and functionality issues through unit, integration and system testing.
Deployment- release the software for users, either in production or for client use.
Maintenance & support- updating and fixing issues, optimizing performance and enhancements based on user feedback


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**waterfall methodologies follow a sequential, linear approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It is rigid, changes are difficult to implement once development starts while agile methodologies happens in cycles where small portions of the software are developed and tested continuously.
waterfall methodology would be appropriate for a government agency developing a tax filing system because the requirements are clear from the start and regulatory compliance must be strictly followed while agile methodology would be appropriate for aa start up developing a mobile app because the company releases new features in phases, gather user feedback and adjust the app based on market trends**

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- designing, coding, testing and maintaining software applications.

Quality assurance engineer- ensure the programs meet the quality standards before it is released.

project manager- ensure the project/program meets the deadline and is able to meet clients expectation and budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide an environment for coding, debugging and testing. Example pycharm while version control systems is a tool that tracks changes to code, allowing developers to collaborate and maintain different versions of a project. Example Github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with rapid changing technologies- work on side projects to practice new technologies.
debugging and troubleshooting- implement logging and error handling meachanisms
meet tight deadlines- prioritize tasks using project management tools like Jira or Trello.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing prevents defects, enhance performance and improve security
Unit testing- tests individual components or functions of the software.
Integration testing- check if different modules work together correctly.
system testing- test the entire system to ensure overall functionality.
User acceptance Testing- performed by end users to validate the software before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering- structuring prompts in a way that helps the AI generate accurate, relevant and high quality outputs.
Importance
maximizes AI performance- well crafted propmpts improve the accuracy and relevance of AI responses
saves time and effort- reduces trial and error by guiding the AI effectively.
improves automation- essential for AI drivn workflows insoftware development, content creation and customer support.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example: tell me about databases.
Improved prompt: explain the key differences between relational and NoSQL databases, foucsing on their use cases.- a well structured prompt leads to more accurate, relevant and actionable responses.
